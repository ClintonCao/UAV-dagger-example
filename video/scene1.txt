- Start opening with eclipse and thousand warnings in the project
- Run the tool
- Visualizer:

scene 1::::
something general about project + Locate high warning density 
- Go down to TypeNames.java
- All warnings are blue this means all warnings are generated by checkstyle
- When we switch color mode to category we see that all warnings are of type defect
    - On HOVER over we see that most warnings are about documentation conventions
    - At the RIGHT handside we see that 45 are documentation and a few style we disable them
    because they do not  matter when searching for critical warnings.
    - We can TOGGLE these off and we can see the remaining warnings in the code
    - now we move back up a level 
    - because of the Category color scale, now we can see that almost all warnings are from type Maintainability defects
    - when we switch colors to ASAT we see almost all warnings are generated by checkstyle.
    - we go an other level up back to the top
- We disable checkstyle to get a clear overview of the PMD warnings.
- Now all classes are green which represents PMD or gray which means no warnings at all
- Lets take a closer look at one of the remaining PMD warnings   
dagger / dagger.producers.monitoring / ProductionComponentTimingRecorder.java
- Here we see that this warning is about code structure and we now know ... where to find it/ how to fix it?? idk what
::: end scene 1



- Maybe we only care about best practices... 
dagger / dagger.internal.codegen / OptionalType.java
